# Nocoin™ Sharding Proposal

## Introduction
As the Nocoin™ network grows, implementing sharding will be essential for maintaining scalability and performance. This proposal outlines the proposed sharding model.

## Objectives
- **Increase Transaction Throughput**: Allow multiple transactions to be processed in parallel.
- **Improve Network Efficiency**: Reduce the load on individual nodes by distributing data across shards.

## Proposed Sharding Model
1. **Shard Structure**: Each shard will have its own state and transaction history.
2. **Cross-Shard Communication**: Implement efficient mechanisms for communication between shards to ensure consistency and validity.

## Next Steps
- **Research & Development**: Explore existing sharding implementations in other blockchains.
- **Community Feedback**: Solicit feedback from the community before finalizing the implementation plan.
