# Nocoin™ Sharding Proposal

## Introduction
Implementing sharding will enhance scalability and performance as Nocoin™ grows.

## Objectives
- **Increase Throughput**: Enable parallel transaction processing.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce load on nodes by distributing data.

## Proposed Model
1. **Shard Structure**: Each shard will have its own state.
2. **Cross-Shard Communication**: Ensure efficient communication for consistency.

## Next Steps
- Research existing sharding implementations.
- Gather community feedback on the proposal.
